umang bansal | 23f1002940 | 31-10-2024

* **Data Scraping**: Used a GitHub token and implemented a 1-second delay between requests to avoid exceeding API rate limits. Processed data through custom functions and stored the results in CSV format for further analysis.
* **Interesting Finding**: Analysis showed that developers marked as "hireable" maintain, on average, 54.05% more public repositories than non-hireable developers, suggesting that public repos play a role in personal branding for hireability. Additionally, a positive trend was observed where developers with higher public repo counts tend to be more hireable, potentially due to a stronger portfolio appeal.
* **Developer Recommendation**: To maximize performance, developers should avoid high-traffic hours on GitHub (6:00 am to 6:00 pm) for uploading large files, as activity is generally lower outside these hours. Moreover, new accounts created in January tend to gain more followers on average, so starting fresh at the beginning of the year could offer a visibility advantage.
